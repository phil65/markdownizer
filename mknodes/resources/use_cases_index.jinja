There are a lot of different ways MkNodes can be used to generate
websites. This section will highlight some of them.


**MkNodes** can be used in many different ways

* Create complete websites
    * **MkNodes** can be used to create a whole website (like it is done with this page)

* Load existing websites and extend it
    * By using `MkNav.parse.folder` / `MkNav.parse.file` as well as `MkPage.from_file`,
      the existing Markdown pages can become part of our tree
      (which we can then extend programatically)

* Create a subsection with **MkNodes** and reference it from your "static" page.
    * You can also set a section name for your root `MkNav` and reference that from your
      `nav:` section in mkdocs.yml

* Create single static pages / blocks for your page
    You can also just use **MkNodes** to create some Nodes, stringify them and include
    the markdown in your static pages. It can also be used to create your GitHub / PyPi
    overview page.

* Using `Markdown-Exec` or similar inline execution plugins
    You can also embed **MkNodes** code directly by using various plug-ins
    (personal recommendation: `Markdown-Exec`) For most cases the built-in
    jinja environment should include enough to display complex Markdown in an easy way.

* Create "multi-pages"
  MkNodes can even "merge" multiple websites into one.
  In its core, MkNodes is nothing more than one large tree ranging from the start page
  down to individual markdown elements,
  where you can put  all leafs to the places where you want.
  ItÂ´s easy to make a complete website tree the subtree of another Parent-tree.

  * Create a "structure template" for multiple sites
   MkNodes separates content and appearance to a large extent. Website templates
   can be written in a way that they work for multiple websites without any manual adaption.
   (Check out the very basic included `MkDefaultWebsite` and `MkEmptyWebsite` nodes as an example)
