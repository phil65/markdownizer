When a website build is started, MkNodes will collect as much information as possible
about the context by inspecting the distribution info, the local git repository, the remote GitHub repository as well as other related information. That information is used to build a context, thus enabling the MkNodes to display project information without explicitely "hardcoding" the project.

The collected information is also used to populate the MkNodes-specific Jinja namespace. In combination with the MkNode jinja filters, this allows to efficiently write documentation about your project as well as building project-agnostic websites / website parts which can be re-used across different projects.

### These are the available namespaces available in the Jinja2 environment:

{{ namespaces | MkDefinitionList }}


#### Example:

This call would pass the module of the current context to MkPipDepTree and let it create a dependency graph:

{ { metadata.module | MkPipDepTree(direction="LR") } }
