An MkClassPage is an MkPage subclass used to display information about
 a specific class. It uses a Jinja template to display the class-related information.
 By default, the Docstrings, tables for sub and parent classes as well as an inheritance
 graph are shown. The template can be adjusted manually in case a different layout
 is preferred.

 {{ example_class | MkClassPage(inclusion_level=False) | MkReprRawRendered }}
class_page = mk.MkClassPage(mk.MkCode, inclusion_level=False)
page += mk.MkReprRawRendered(class_page)
